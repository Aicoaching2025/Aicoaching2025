<br />
i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual:
either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i
can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i
forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the
simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater
salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i
know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to
make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy
way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year
old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to
only wear leather shoes dress shoes.<br />

about you:<br />
<br />
you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about
really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a
light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you
have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons
with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still
at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the
wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my
favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a
good attention span.","currently working as an international agent for a freight

38,thin,anything,socially,,graduated from masters program,"i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online
dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as
earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before
the world.<br />
<br />
i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find
myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and
acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on
this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that
aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a
friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex
filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle
statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text
without moving quickly on to another search result, you are
probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at
first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid
you, but that seems silly.<br />
<br />
as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of
the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you
get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that
while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and
by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that
way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself
gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are
too.","i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to
indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from
the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more
concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual
form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance,
noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at
least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven
activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi
to try and gently flirt with ego death.","improvising in different contexts. alternating between being
present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both
at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said
conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that
transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening
to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large
gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and
raunchy humor.","my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people
comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an
unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more
directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back
to this.","okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it's like
being in the crosshairs.<br />
<br />
for what it's worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than
fiction. it's usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text
by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille,
baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i'll
often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix
as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i've read of eco,
perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i
was young, i was a rabid asimov reader.<br />
<br />
directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky,
herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang,
gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc.
but i also like a good amount of ""trashy"" stuff. too much to
name.<br />
<br />
i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long
form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which
a 1-2hr movie usually can't compete with. some of my recent tv
favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the
prisoner, lost, fringe.<br />
<br />
a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay:
art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers,
maurizio, rob hood, dan bell, james blake, nonesuch recordings,
omar souleyman, ethiopiques, fela kuti, john cage, meredith monk,
robert ashley, terry riley, yoko ono, merzbow, tom tom club, jit,
juke, bounce, hyphy, snap, crunk, b'more, kuduro, pop, noise, jazz,
techno, house, acid, new/no wave, (post)punk, etc.<br />
<br />
a few of the famous art/dance/theater folk that might locate my
sensibility: andy warhol, bruce nauman, yayoi kusama, louise
bourgeois, tino sehgal, george kuchar, michel duchamp, marina
abramovic, gelatin, carolee schneeman, gustav metzger, mike kelly,
mike smith, andrea fraser, gordon matta-clark, jerzy grotowski,

appreciated. there is something special in each and every moment
that you experience in your daily waking life. this something
brings us back to the age old question: if a tree falls in the
forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? this
works in the same way. if you are not consciously there to hear it,
see it, taste it, smell it, feel it none of this matters, it's
still there. pay attention to the little things, those that are

call life.","plotting to take over the world with my army of segway riding

28,average,mostly anything,socially,never,graduated from college/university,"i was born in wisconsin, grew up in iowa, and moved to california
three years ago for a combination of work opportunity and just
wanting to live in sf. it took me a couple years to get to the
peninsula, but i'm glad i eventually got here. i'm passionate about
people and have a wide variety of interests and talents.<br />
<br />
i'm also continually learning about myself. for example, i'm
learning very recently that as a result of spending all my time
growing up, in college, and for the last five years focusing on
growing my ""deep relationship"" skills, i'm not as good as i
previously thought at initializing friendships/relationships. i
guess that isn't all a bad thing since the ""first impression"" thing
only really happens once with each person. :)<br />
<br />
as a result, i love my friends, i've got a lot of deep friendships,
and know how much richer a friendship can get as it gets
deeper.<br />
<br />
i'm passionate about music, i play the guitar, write songs (less
now than before), write plays (more now than before), want to learn
french and asl, am pretty good for an amateur ballroom dancer, can
do almost everything moderately well (seriously, no joke), love
bright ties and shoes, am a jacket and jeans person, and absolutely
love figuring out how people tick. i think i'm pretty cool and wish
more people would be patient enough to take the time to see
that.<br />
<br />
every friend i've ever had say i'm nothing like anyone else. so i
don't come off like anyone else. i'm my own person. and i'm proud
of that.","i'm currently the youngest member on an internal strategy team for
a large bank. it may sound boring, but i'm a big fan of the
opportunities it entails. i get to be exposed to really
intelligent, deliberately organized people be purposeful in a high
paced business environment. it's pretty awesome soaking up all
their knowledge while contributing what i can.<br />
<br />
i'm happy with who i am and would enjoy adding someone else to the
mix.","i'm really good at a little bit of everything. there isn't much i
truly excel in, but i'm above average to good in almost every area.
i take pride in being able to do a lot of different things. for
example, i have a tiny bit of talent/skill in writing,
wood-carving, cooking, singing, playing a guitar, drawing, sewing,
etc. i grew up in a household that had to make a lot of the things
we needed, so you kind of picked up these things along the way.","the way i dress. some days it's hats, other days it's different
ties. most days it's shoes and jackets. just another way to express
myself.<br />
<br />
i've also decided that people notice how i'm not what they
expected. i find myself unpurposefully continually surprising
people, and i think i like that. :)","books = yes. avid reader.<br />

don't even really play video games all that often. i actually
create/play music way more often in my spare time.<br />

i'm starting a new life here in ca and really excited about it. i
only knew one person in this area when i moved here, but i wasn't

lived, i've made at least a few life-long friends. i'm definitely
looking to do the same thing here.<br />

lifestyle. i'm really looking forward to doing some camping,
backpacking, biking, etc in ca. i also really enjoy going out for a
nice meal and some tasty cocktails or beer, or doing the music
nightlife thing. i dj (drum n bass) from time to time, and i've
already landed a few gigs in the bay area. i'm very much involved
in dnb and other electronic genres, but i love live music just as

somewhat vulgar flare (i hope you can take a joke-offensive or
not).<br />
<br />
i'm a constant seeker of discovering something new, whether it be a
different restaurant, culture, or music (anything really). i tend
to have an eclectic personality.<br />
<br />
i volunteer and participate with a lot of activities with my
community. i also tend to seek those who have a story, any story.
i'm all ears! i want to learn from you, hear what you have to say,
and relate it to my own personal experience.<br />

i'm a bit of a nerd and like to watch the history, military, and
discovery channel. something about militaristic strategies intrigue
me.<br />

video games, and working out consistently. i also have the guilty
pleasure of watching ridiculous comedy (family guy, curb your

rationally thinking. i find this to be extremely rare

i'm really good at tinkering with things on the side, being that i
crave discovery and self knowledge, so in a sense i'm good at
figuring things out on my own.","physically-i've been told my eyes. people usually like how i can
turn a serious situation into something relaxing and fun. i tend to
make shy people ""talk"" to me...but i keep hearing that's a plus.","i'm much more of a movie goer. favorite actor: edward norton.
favorite actress : rachel weise. favorite director: darren
aronofsky . that should give you a pretty good idea of the type of
movies i like.<br />

i absolutely love to dance! nothing is a better stress reliever
than hitting the dance floor with good company.<br />
<br />
hands down though, my ultimate love affair with music is
essentially classic rock. the scorpions are absolutely my favorite
band because they bring a smile to my face every time i hear them.
they were also the best concert i've ever attended.<br />

opportunities... you name it. i am a social animal and appreciate

mannerisms, i seem like quite the ""typical"" guy: i love to drink
beer, play sports, i listen to reggae, dubstep and hip-hop, and
enjoy a beach full of bikini-clad women as much as anyone. however,
yes, i can also be a bisexual, swinging, polyamorous, and
debaucherous individual. but that is just a part of me, and all
that really means anyway is i'm open minded. i have always fully
imagined marrying and having kids one day, but i'm open to whatever
life may bring. while i am secretly and totally a hopeless
romantic, i am not trying to rush in to things or grow up too
fast.<br />

still adventurous... i try not to take the day-to-day of life too
seriously. :-)<br />

a note on ""bisexuality"":<br />
for you hetero-normative folk: do not be afraid of the term
""bisexual"". it is just a term, and a very limiting one at that. i
am just as heterosexual as a ""straight man"". i am just as
homosexual as a ""gay"" man. and just because i may be bisexual and
perhaps polyamorous, does not mean that i am unable to be in a
happy, committed, and fulfilling relationship with a single
partner. in fact, such an arrangement has been my norm.","i am living. bartending, schooling, rocking out to my radio...

by day, i'm a mild-mannered designer in an office. by evening, an
inventor, artist, and adventurer. by night, a competition dancer
and jet-setter to fun and glamour.<br />
<br />
""oh - you're a designer?"" you say. ""that's interesting!"" you lie.
exactly! ""designer"" is a great thing to be, because you can put it
on forms and stuff to answer the ""what do you do?"" question without
actually answering it. ""designer"" tells you nothing. i could be
working in fashion, cars, systems, furniture, ads, events,
landscapes, websites, aircraft, or anything! ""ah yes, very clever,
haha etc etc. so what kind of designer are you then?"" well, some of
you reading this will have purchased my work. that kind of designer

sound british to most americans, australian to some, but while
these are good guesses, neither is quite correct.<br />

is the gayest straight man in the world - he has good taste, knows
how to decorate, has a real sense of style"".<br />

clearly she completely failed to notice my impressive aura of
menace and seductive evil radiating across the land. actually,
no-one seems to notice it. i think my aura might be broken.<br />
<br />
a friend i met on this site just called me ""a rare gem in the
wasteland of okstupid"". i hope there is a gem around here somewhere
for me!","i like books &amp; movies &amp; music, just like you!<br />
<br />
i'm not actually much of a believer in seeking out only people that
you have lots in common with. it might be easier to go on a date if
you're both always wanting to see the same movies, but i think the
really great times are often the ones where you end up doing
something you've never done before (and never dreamed you would),
because the other person's different interests give you access to
worlds that you probably wouldn't stumble into without them.
through each other, you both end up more magnificent!","i have whatever is the opposite of chronic depression - i am pretty
much hardwired to remain happy, regardless of what is going down.
so i figure i won at least one of life's major lotteries.<br />
<br />
on a different tack, i once lost mobility due to my leg being
sliced open when i accidentally... er... i mean... in the midst of
battle while i was fending off dozens of those bad guys from the
lord of the rings films. yeah - dozens! anyway, i got so sick of
not being able to do stuff, that i eventually ended up at a big new
year's bash a few weeks later, dancing through the painkillers,
doing my leg no favours, but having a blast. thus, i think dancing
would probably be on the list. as to the other four things, they're
classified. may i see your security clearance please? wait - you're
telling me you don't have a security clearance? sir/maam, this is a
restricted area. if you would like clearance, you will need to step
over here for the security screening...","i like the often refreshingly blunt and uncomfortable insights
about us that are laid bare by oktrends.<br />
<br />
on the subject of oktrends, you might notice that my profile says
i'm 6'2"" tall. but if we measure in okcupid inches, i'm nearly
6'4""! we know this because oktrends cleverly deduced that men here
inflate their height by an average of 2"", while i happen to know
that i only inflated mine by a fraction of an inch, so as to get a
round number. (clearly i'm a rebel, living dangerously! or
something).","once upon a time i might have been out conversing and dining with
friends, but then i moved here where i don't know anyone. perhaps
i'd be out dancing somewhere. perhaps at home, working on secret
projects. ask me.","you wouldn't believe me anyway, so nevermind. :-p<br />
<br />
random fact: i was bitten by a (presumably) radioactive insect,
exploring the exclusion zone at chernobyl. any day now i'll
discover my super-powers. any day...<br />
<br />
another (not very) secret:<br />
i get lower auto insurance premiums than you - despite being male
and having a (very) fast car. how is that fair? well, there's a
trick to it...<br />
but i plan to get an electric car and build my own solar powerplant
to help fuel it. (i've done a bunch of smaller solar projects. i
love the permanence of it - building something that can run forever
- the other parts will fail before the power source does.)","you're participating in the human trials of the oragenics

did i visit your profile more than once but not send you a message?
that's because email is a pretty lousy way to try to meet someone,

with it, i try not to bandy about things that they would rather
keep private.<br />

good enough and i'm smart enough and gosh darnit, people like me""
way. you know from the depth of your being that you are an amazing
individual and you're looking for someone who can appreciate
everything you are. you probably still worry sometimes about what
people think of you, but that's only because you surround yourself
with other intelligent, creative, interesting, physically fit
people like yourself. who doesn't occasionally get intimidated in
that company?<br />
<br />
you appreciate the physical beauty of the human body. you are a
very sensual being. human touch is very important. hugs, kisses,
massage, and sex. people skirt around the topic of sex all the
time, but lets face it, sex is a very important aspect of a
relationship for someone like you or me and there's no point
wasting our time in a situation where the sex is less than
phenominal. i'm excited to hear about your turn-ons and
fantasies.<br />
<br />
money is not really an issue for you - not because you're obscenely
rich, that's not really important. i just mean that you have no
trouble making the life you want for yourself. you appreciate that
we are a very gifted, fortunate people to live as we do.<br />
<br />
you give back to this wonderful community you live in.<br />
<br />
you love to keep in shape by doing things, as opposed to just going
to the gym for an hour a day. mt biking, rock climbing, surfing,
kite surfing, running, hiking, snowshoeing, telemark, snowboarding,
road biking, swimming, tai chi, qigong, and yoga all sound
interesting to you even though you haven't tried them all yet.
maybe you won't even like all of them, but at least you're excited
to give them all a try.<br />
<br />
you are not a serial monogomist. you are independent and
comfortable being alone. it's fun to date and meet new people, but
you're not going to settle for anything less than you deserve.
ultimately you crave a relationship you can commit to for the rest
of your life. you are looking for a loving relationship based on
good communication and trust.<br />

i'm the did you know guy: i'm always researching and analyzing.
if i know a friend is working on a project i'll send them relevant
ideas and articles i come across. however, my intellectual prowess
doesn't permeate to all aspects of my life. my friends make fun of
me for being an absent-minded-professor type. give me hard problem
and i'll excel, but moving out of my apartment? it might as well be
rocket science. eek, there's always room for improvement!<br />

never visited. japan is next on my list, though i'd visit germany
or london again in a heartbeat.<br />

there's a more intuitive side to my life, too. recently i've been
enthusiastically exploring buddhism and meditation, paying

less i know. it's so refreshing to be awash in the mystery of the

food: i am a healthy eater naturally. i really try to avoid
franchise or chain restaurants at all costs - simply because i find
them horribly impersonal and they give me flashbacks of my many
days as a serving robot. i love to find the mom &amp; pops type
small restaurants that serve large portions of food i can neither
pronounce or recreate at home. these are nearly extinct in silicon
valley so i generally choose to cook at home and love the
atmosphere it creates. good friends, a bottle of wine, music,
laughter and hot food sizzling on the stove is my idea of a perfect

29,thin,,socially,sometimes,working on masters program,"i think i may be one of those twentysomethings you read about in
the new york times who took so much longer than their parents did
to get their lives together. thankfully, things have progressed
magnificently in the last couple years, and i'm proud to say that i
again feel cool enough for online dating.<br />
<br />
i'm in a master's program for counseling psychology and am entering
my second year of clinical training, which means i am actually
being entrusted with the emotional well-being of strangers. it is
astonishing, profound, peculiar, transformational work that i find
deeply gratifying. but don't worry: i've retained my taste for the
absurd, and eventually do tire of talking about feelings.<br />
<br />
because everything sounds better in list-form, the following are
some arbitrarily chosen facts about myself:<br />
<br />
(1) i can win staring contests with cats.<br />
(2) in my off-hours i read, exercise, converse, study, garden,
meditate, do <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=arty+things"">arty
things</a>, and plan lots of projects that i only sometimes start
and almost never finish.<br />
(3) i own three chess sets, but don't play chess.<br />
(4) in people, i like a precise mix of church giggles and
smoldering contemplation; my friends, failing to achieve the
impossible, tend to gravitate dramatically toward one extreme or
the other.<br />
(5) i am deeply offended by bad art, and i'm not sure why.<br />
(6) i am not above eating an entire plate of kale and then going to
smoke a cigarette.<br />
(7) i can yawn without moving my face.<br />
(8) i have a contradictory blend of intense compassion and utter
self-absorption.<br />
(9) i enjoy silence, but not in elevators.<br />
(10) i have been a beginning yoga student for 8 years.<br />
(11) i can never seem to stand up straight, but when i do: watch
out. my height has been described by some as ""gangly"" and others as
""elven"", which to me are two very different things. i have also
been told i resemble a ""bundle of sticks.""<br />
(12) my best friend once told me that if i turned out to be a
figment of her imagination she wouldn't be surprised, which we
agreed was both an enormous compliment and a colossal insult.<br />
(13) my pet peeves include people who make noise in movie theaters,
a lopsided pasta/sauce ratio, and those who take a really long time
in single-occupancy public restrooms even though they know others
are waiting because the door handle has jiggled like seven times.
also, i think people who feel they're too good to bag their own
groceries are disgusting.<br />
(14) ""winged migration"" has been in my netflix queue for 4
years.<br />
(15) i have 35 plants in my room, a la max from where the wild
things are.<br />

someone.<br />

<br />
though i enjoy my forays into the castro, i don't like to play by

more interesting, as gay professionals (/academics) rather than
professional gays. authenticity and straightforwardness are
attractive; role-stereotypes aren't (including the need to be
'straight-acting'). just be.<br />
<br />
great expectations (mostly for myself) aside, i'm actually more
easy-going and play well with others. i've recently been described
by a straight buddy as being perfectly comfortable living life as
both a gay bachelor and a straight ex-fratboy -- i'm not entirely
sure where he got the fratboy bit, but i think i know what he
meant.","i've earned my ba in political science and my ma in economics, and
while working in the wine industry to pay bills, i'm otherwise
looking at jobs in quantitative evaluation (frustrating in this
market) and phd programs in development economics. my sojourn into
'the dismal science' began more out of a sense of necessity, but
it's since become a preferred approach. i like all things
politically and economically behavioral generally, integrating a
mix of political/social psychology and political economy/public
choice. ultimately i'd like to land in a research/advisory role in
either some para-statal organization (e.g., the international bank
for reconstruction and development) or in academia. perhaps
teach.<br />

all the wrong places.","what i'm really good at is for others to decide. but i do know that
i really enjoy languages, classical music (background in choral
singing), trail- and distance-running, watching and playing soccer,
hiking, camping, traveling, etc. all in no particular order.",,"as for books, i've been trying to (re-)read some of the literary
classics: austen's emma and pride and prejudice, chopin's the
awakening, homer's the odyssey, faulkner's a light in august,
hugo's les miserables, morrison's beloved and twain's the
adventures of huckleberry finn. on a lighter note, i love
frankfurt's on bullshit.<br />
<br />
as for movies, i think film can be an awesome medium for ideas and
emotions. i tend to prefer dramas carrying some meaning, typically
without the canned happy endings. i like things that provide food
for thought, rather than clean and prefabricated conclusions:
nowhere in africa, the lives of others, we don't live here anymore,
the hours, before sunset, the talented mr. ripley, doubt, the time
that remains, elizabeth, the reader. of course, i like political
thrillers as well: the hunt for red october, the contender, the
bourne trilogy, etc.<br />
<br />
in the last ten years i've not had a tv more often than not, and i
appreciated the greater freedom it allowed me. i feel better
watching or listening to news shows like the news hour or morning
edition or all things considered. still, i like to be entertained:

awesome, but it's not expected. if you're one of the ""i avoid

walking policy wonks, but some modicum of interest in and awareness
of what's happening in the world is important to me. and, while
self-assuredness and confidence are attractive, so is an
understanding of humility and of hubris. not to mention a sense of

i'm kind of a goofball, but in a subtle ways for the most part. dry
humour, sarcasm. i guess i just find humour/interest in many things
that most people don't even notice. i'm quirky...but endearingly so
(or so people say). i spend a lot of time looking for new (to me,
anyway) music to add to my collection, looking for interesting
events/activities/hobbies to try out around the city and revising
mental maps of where i'd like to end up eventually. i love hunting
for just the right vintage pieces. naturally, i'm an etsy whore,
and can be found perusing vintage furniture stores, especially the
alameda county antique fairs. my most recent vintage purchase was a
gorgeous grundig majestic record console, i do believe it's my
favourite piece of furniture i own now.<br />
<br />
i like trying out cozy new places to eat, and new recipes, but i'm
not by any stretch of the mind a 'foodie'. i frequent wine bars and
coffee shops, bay area staples. i _love_ the beach...i totally
appreciate being relatively close to the beach, after having lived
in ny, where the beach was neither close to the city nor
worthwhile. i like finding fun new ways of being active, like
finding new trails to jog, paths to bike or walls to climb. going
on spontaneous adventures is one of my favourite things to do, and
a fun way to get to know people. i love all things creative, so art
walks, gallery openings, live performances, museums, activities
that involve creating art, are all places that i tend to gravitate
towards...and i'm always looking for more people to that are also
into these kinds of events.<br />
<br />
i'm into technology, particularly mobile, which is the industry i
work in. it's a long story as to how i got here, but it's where i
want to be and i actually don't hate my job. i tweet and facebook.
and read tech blogs like engadget and gigaom to keep up with the
current goings on with the latest gadgets. but, i also read
magazines like juxtapoz, big up, etc. because i love them and for
the way it offsets the techier stuff in my line up.<br />
<br />
when it comes to friends, i'm super loyal and i think respect is
important. bad communication in any relationship, friendship or
otherwise is the kiss of death in my opinion, and a personal pet
peeve of mine. i like to be as up front as possible in most
situations...even if that's not what the person wants to
hear.<br />
<br />
eventually, i'd love to settle down with someone who i really
enjoy, respect, and feel a strong connection with. ideally, i'd
like for that person to be pretty different from me, into their own
scene, but still have some interests overlap with mine. i don't
really like to rush into dating, but when i find someone i like, i
tend to want to spend time, and get to know them. i'm a cuddler.
and a hand holder. and a just because-er. and likely, a
professional grade spooner. although dating-wise, this past year
has been very mismatched for me, as it seems that i haven't been
into the people that have been into me, and vice versa. hopefully
eventually, a mutual dig will occur...i wouldn't settle for
anything less.<br />

equality. if you don't, we might not get along so well. just

outdoors even though i don't get out as often as i'd like to,

will find the way, because i'm not lost and i know exactly where
i'm going.<br />
<br />
i have a vast amount of interests, love art, i live for<br />
traveling, scuba, i ski/snowboard--poorly, love music festivals

science, poetry--i used to do spoken word shows, i love having
dinner parties,<br />

i am interested in sustainability--recently worked on a

leading to greener lifestyles.<br />

child. i am fun, love being social, have a dry and sarcastic
sense<br />
of humor, at the same time i am sweet and nurturing and in my<br />
private time spend quite a bit of time introverting.<br />
<br />
i have a very different and unique relationship with almost every
person in my life, i dont believe in being generic. growth is
extremely important to me, i am always developing, reinventing, and
improving my self. i looking for the same in a partner.","i used to be an incredibly serious person, now i just try to
live<br />

can. it's hard to reprogram yourself! i feel like i have lived
many<br />
life times and been many people.<br />

i am currently a student at cal, studying cultural
anthropology<br />

export various commodities to the us.","cooking, feeding my friends. nurturing :)<br />

could define whatever i wanted to be true based around time-travel;

figuring out why the universe is the way it is, why society is how
it is, why politics sucks as much as it does, when plural-looking

incorrect variant of chess ever. 4 colors/sides, each representing
an ethnicity. so white pieces could ""oppress"" nearby black pieces,
brown pawns could explode killing nearby units, red pawns could
establish ""reservations"", and black had no king/queen but their
pawns could ""reproduce"" fast to spawn more black pawns. if that
sounds horrible to you then you're a noob, and we probably wouldn't

the question:<br />
<strong>""to you, which adjective best describes hopeless,
unrequited love?""<br />
1. creepy<br />
2. foolish<br />
3. romantic</strong><br />
<em>this question, like most of these questions, is poorly written,
but offers up a very interesting incite into who's paying
attention, and who's not. (i have absolutely no room to be going on
about poorly written anything.)<br />
<br />
i'm shocked at how consistently out of step i apparently am on this
question. most women say 'creepy.' wtf? perhaps, if you're the
desired individual, but that's not what the question is implying.
have none of you ever been in the situation where you wanted
someone who didn't want you in return? falls under the 'unrequited'
umbrella in my book. sometimes you love them and sometimes it's
just desire. so... what's 'creepy' about that?<br />
<br />
then we have, 'foolish.' i'm sorry but for one to be labeled as
'foolish,' the implication is, through your actions, you have
delivered these consequences, leaving nothing but this
hopeless/unrequited love. i do not limit the endless possibility's
to arrive at that dead end, principality driven by ones own
foolishness. sloppy thinking. i'd allow for foolish if the question
was 'what do you think about dwelling in...' remember, we're
answering the question asked.<br />
<br />
if there's a switch somewhere that turns on and off love, and i
have control of that switch, i'd be forever in your debt if you
could point it out to me.<br />
<br />
to be in love and not have that love returned is a shitty feeling
and a shitty space to be in. but i'll bet you kraft dinner this has
happened to most of us a time or two.<br />
it does however, demonstrate the capacity for love. and given the
three poor choices above, i'd choose as 'romantic.'</em><br />
